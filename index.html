# Workshop Overview

The summarization workshop at ACL 2017 aims to bring the community together to discuss current challenges and emerging directions of summarization, and how relevant areas, such as language generation or visualization, can form synergies with this field.

## Topics:

* Abstractive and extractive summarization
* Language generation
* Multiple text genres (News, tweets, product reviews, meeting conversations, forums, lectures, student feedback, emails, medical records, books, research articles, etc)
* Multimodal Input: Information integration and aggregation across multiple modalities (text, speech, image, video)
* Multimodal Output: Summarization and visualization + interactive exploration
* Tailoring summaries to user queries or interests
* Semantic aspects of summarization (e.g. semantic representation, inference, validity)
* Development of new algorithms
* Development of new datasets and annotations
* Development of new evaluation metrics
* Cognitive or psycholinguistic aspects of summarization and visualization (e.g. perceived readability, usability, etc)
